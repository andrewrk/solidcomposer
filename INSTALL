Dependencies:
 * django - http://www.djangoproject.com/
 * south - http://south.aeracode.org/
   - A good database system like postgresql or mysql so that the migration
     stuff can work. (sqlite3 will not work)
 * django-cron - http://code.google.com/p/django-cron/
 * mutagen - http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/
 * PyWaveform - http://github.com/superjoe30/PyWaveform

Procedure:
 * ensure that all dependencies are installed on server
 * copy django code to server
 * configure settings_user.py to override the system-specific settings from settings.py
 * make sure database is migrated to latest version
 * configure files in the /static/* URL to be served statically, bypassing
   django. the files that are served here should be a softlink to media/static/.
 * verify that the cron.py thing is working. if it's not, you need to set up
   a cron job manually to do the task it was going to do.
 * preparser.py parse
   this needs to be re-run any time you change any templates or settings.py
 * run tests
