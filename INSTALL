The first time you install this project, you need to:
    * copy the code to the server
    * put the project in the path so that statements like these will work:
      import settings
      import main.views
    * configure settings_user.py to override the system-specific settings
      from settings.py
    * python manage.py syncdb --noinput
    * python manage.py migrate
    * set up cron jobs
        <minute>     python /path/to/project/manage.py runjob chat leave
        <hourly>     python /path/to/project/manage.py runjobs hourly
        <daily>      python /path/to/project/manage.py runjobs daily
        <weekly>     python /path/to/project/manage.py runjobs weekly
        <monthly>    python /path/to/project/manage.py runjobs monthly 
    * set up mp3 on the media server to be served with
      content-disposition: attachment
    * follow the directions below for deploying

After that, you get to use the happy funtime deploy script (tm)!

  ./deploy

If you need to add a dependency to is project, add it to deps.py.
