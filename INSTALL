Dependencies:
 * django
 * A good database system like postgresql or mysql so that the migration
   stuff (south) can work.
 * south - http://south.aeracode.org/
 * django-cron - http://code.google.com/p/django-cron/
 * mugaten - http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/

Procedure:
 * copy django code to server
 * touch a file called RELEASE to activate release mode in settings.py
 * make sure database is migrated to latest version
 * configure files in the /static/* URL to be served statically, bypassing
   django. the files that are served here should be a softlink to media/static/.
 * verify that the cron.py thing is working. if it's not, you need to set up
   a cron job manually to do the task it was going to do.
