 == to get a prototype working ==
 * automatically bookmark competitions the user creates
 * when you sign in or sign out it should clear the username/pass box
 * uploading an entry should clear that form
 * the online users is sketchy at best
 * competition page
   - listening party behavior
     > 5 seconds buffertime before every track
     > mute button on player
     > make song comments during chat during listening party
   - voting behavior
   - competition closed behavior
     > reveal votes
     > sort the entries by votes
     > each entry is a simple link to the page for the song
   - when the compo goes from one state to another, refresh via ajax
   - handle join/part messages by removing them or adding them to the array
 * register
 * user profile page
 * settings page
 * make the gui pretty
   - date/time widgets for competition form
 * edit competition
 * re-implement safe_model_to_dict to make it safer. should probably have
   explicit safe fields in models.
 * put whitelist/blacklist/open in the create competition page. default open.
 * put a cap on file size of uploaded things
 * buff up safe_file to make unique files as advertised
 * test with a messed up clock
 * instead of serverTime(new Date()) for latest_check, use the timestamp from
   the last received message.
 * support some kind of formatting for author comments and such. minimum:
   honor line breaks. maximum: a bb-like system or markdown.

 == improvements ==
 * pressing enter in the password field should submit the form
 * editing a field when it refreshes
 * the ui glitch when it refreshes
 * protect against h4xz0rz by adding a @method to views which do things like
   login, logout, etc. The method would make sure the referrer was us and not
   some other website.
 * listening party date must be after submission deadline date - put that in
   form validation check
 * implement template caching in Jst parser
 * paging on competitions. right now it sends them all.
 * moderation tools for competitions
 * obfuscate media URLs to protect people's stuff
 * provide some way to format themes, rules, comments, etc
 * chat colors
 * display error when chat message doesn't go through
 * chat: display how many invisible observers there are
 * color the time differently when there isn't much time left so that 
   people know they're running out of time
 * competition entry max length per competition
 * better feedback for a failed submission than an alert box.
 * make the gui experience of clicking edit on a submission and then
   deciding not to better.
 * replay listening party feature
  - put an indicator on the page so you know whether it's live or replay
