Release "April Rain" (The Cynic Project)
= sitewide =
 * edit competition
 * recent activty entry log:
   > band member leaving
   > trashed project
   > invitations sent out
   > pokes
 * when inviting a solid composer user, use a dropdown like github does to help them pick
 * gotta follow copyright on the icons from icon finder. have a database of icons used
   with authors and a link so that I can have an attribution page at the bottom.
 * html emails as well as text.
 * spam protection on contact page
 * javascript tests
 * have a progress bar during uploads
 * faster page loads by including the initial JSON request response in the served page
 * refactor: django already has a storage engine type thing. use it instead
   of my own hacked class
 * refactor: use one image for buttons and use css to change offset. (for example pause/play hover/not hovered)
 * stats
   # on songs
     > how many plays
       - partial
       - complete
     > how many downloads
   # band page views
   # fans
 * when you click something to load the next page, replace the contents with
   the loading thing
 * ability to change password
 * make the login ALWAYS ajax. the consistency will help user confidence.
 * IE8 support
 * refactor
   > change competitions to arena
   > change workshop to workbench
 * user settings:
   > connect a user's account with last.fm to scrobble tracks that they listen to
   > ability to check/uncheck plugins that a user owns
   > whether to bleepy boop when people chat
 * band settings
   > visibility options
   > ban people
 * serializablemodel: should only follow chains if the names match
 * refactor: add the <pre></pre> stripping to AIM instead of doing it every time.
 * ability to flag tracks as abuse

= chat =
 * don't render ALL the chat messages every time.
 * clicking onliners should open a new window
 * increase onliners timeout
 * make the chat more friendly to use for people who are used to IRC
   > make the page flash (or change the title text to indicate) when 
     someone's name is mentioned in IRC
   > ability to private message?
   > display error when chat message doesn't go through
 * display how many invisible observers there are
   - by IP address?

= arena =
 * add tips to arena
 * chrome bug: sometimes it plays the same song again during listening party
 * the listening party starts over after it ends. whoops.
 * listening party - make song comments during chat during listening party
 * it's possible to double-vote for someone
 * entry list: "so far" is misleading. use a better word.
 * send emails when voting results are in
 * there's a security hole - javascript knows where the song mp3s are way
   before it should.
 * beginning of song gets cut off during listening party. set it up
   so that it sets up a setTimeout() to play it right on time instead
   of cutting into the time.
 * user profile page
   - show their competition entries
 * show and allow posting comments on songs on user pages
 * longer entry names look bad in the entry list
 * user-highlighted song text is mis-aligned
 * userpage open in a new window
 * show listening party buffer time
 * ability to just set a delay for a listening party as opposed to a date
 * if you're listening to an entry during voting, and then voting ends
   and the entries re-order, it will show you as listening to the wrong entry.
 * show competition length as metadata
 * auto theme generator
 * arena - the competitions aren't updating on a second based timer
   > make it a second-based timer but not suck to click the link
 * if creating a competition fails, have a message at the top saying
   "please correct these errors."
 * show upcoming/new competitions before old ones in bookmarked
   competitions. there should be a clear divide.
   > better competition ordering in arena
 * better moderator features
   > ability to pause, skip, previous in listening party
   > ability to open submission up even during listening party
   > ability to kick people out (blacklist) if they're misbehaving
   > compo owner can make other people moderators too
 * when they click resubmit, scroll down the page to see the form.
 * put whitelist/blacklist/open in the create competition page. default open.
   - invitation system based on passwords
   - ability to have private compo by invitation
 * ability to replay the listening party
   - put an indicator on the page so you know whether it's live or replay
 * protect against h4xz0rz by adding a @method to views which do things like
   login, logout, etc. The method would make sure the referrer was us and not
   some other website.
 * color the time differently when there isn't much time left so that 
   people know they're running out of time
 * play a noise that indicates listening party is starting

 * allow uploading ogg
 * Integrate chat from an IRC channel.
 * google calendar integration
 * rss feed for competitions
 * ability to customize the design

= song player
 * dependencies dialog: have a Samples heading.
   - if any missing samples: in red say e.g. "17 Missing Samples"
   - if any downloadable samples: have a samples link which closes the dialog and opens the samples dialog.
 * don't cover up the waveform with the comment box
 * comments
   - handle the case when they're not logged in. it should guide them through the process smoothly
   - glitchy behavior when trying to click the x on a comment box during song playback
     > if they click the x during playback, take it as clicking the hide comments button.
   - if deleting a comment ends up meaning that you can delete a tree, do it. maybe do this on a cron job.
   click the download samples button. they're missing from the box.
 * download mp3: box instead of link

= workbench =
 * cancel button on rename form
 * cancel button on upload samples
 * make logging out and logging in nice.
   > log out - should hide everything on the page and say you need to log in
   > log in - everything should appear
   > should never have to leave the page
 * email band members when someone uploads a new project. this should be toggleable in settings
 * project manager
   > project filters
     - use an ordered dictionary for the filters.
     - learn the initial filter from the anchor name
 * poke
   > can poke max. once every day
 * project page
   > paging on versions
   > make #anchor names work for versions. currently they don't work automatically because the <a name="aoeu"> is
     created after the page loads.
 * create a low quality mp3 preview of every sample uploaded so that we are able to play all sample types
 * workbench page
   > fan page activity
     - download count in the past 24 hours

   > vote to scrap / unvote to scrap
   > vote to promote / unvote to promote
   > subscribe / unsubscribe
   > scrap without voting
   > recycle
   > delete permanently
     - make the user feel really guilty about permanently deleting stuff
 * add a thumbs up button (rating system) for plugins.
   > add a description and photo field for plugins
   > come up with a plan for how they get updated. (possibly a simple link to
     notify that information is outdated?)
 * refactor: PluginDepenency mispelled
 * warning when you upload a song to a band, if any of the band members are
   missing dependencies
 * it's misleading to have the song rename field and not support renames without a project.

 * handle ambiguous samples with a choice when the song is uploaded.
   > one of the choices should be: use sample X, and delete the other one
 * allow clearing samples or deleting individual ones

 * ability to create albums and organize like that
 * ability to set up your band so that anyone who donates credits gets critic access, etc
 * ability to customize css
   > on fan page
   > on project manager
 * users can request to join a band
   > ability to turn off requests or specify a reputation threshold
 * support merging and forking
   > if you have access to the source of another band's song, you can fork it
     into your own project manager
 * show who is voting to scrap, who is voting to promote

= fan page / interface with band page =

  * ducking / sidechaining
  * cutting unecessary eq when mastering
