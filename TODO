 == to get a prototype working ==
 * competition page
   - chat box

   - basic page with javascript working
   - replay listening party feature
     > put an indicator on the page so you know whether it's live or replay
 * register
 * user profile page
 * settings page
 * make the gui pretty
   - date/time widgets for competition form

 == improvements ==
 * pressing enter in the password field should submit the form
 * editing a field when it refreshes
 * the ui glitch when it refreshes
 * protect against h4xz0rz by adding a @method to views which do things like
   login, logout, etc. The method would make sure the referrer was us and not
   some other website.
 * listening party date must be after submission deadline date - put that in
   form validation check
 * implement template caching in Jst parser
 * paging on competitions. right now it sends them all.
 * moderation tools for competitions
 * obfuscate media URLs to protect people's stuff
