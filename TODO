 == to get a prototype working ==
 * competition page
   - disallow voting for yourself
 * make the gui usable
   - date/time widgets for competition form
 * validate dates when making a new competition (deadline can't be before
   start_date, etc)
 * re-implement safe_model_to_dict to make it safer. should probably have
   explicit safe fields in models.
 * put a cap on file size of uploaded things
 * buff up safe_file to make unique files as advertised
 * test with a messed up clock in windows
   - possibly use ajax to improve offset calculation between server and local.
 * instead of serverTime(new Date()) for latest_check, use the timestamp from
   the last received message.
 * paging on competitions. right now it sends them all.
 * make sure it works in 
   - IE 8
   - chrome
   - safari

 == improvements ==
 * protect against h4xz0rz by adding a @method to views which do things like
   login, logout, etc. The method would make sure the referrer was us and not
   some other website.
 * listening party date must be after submission deadline date - put that in
   form validation check
 * implement template caching in Jst parser
 * moderation tools for competitions
 * obfuscate media URLs to protect people's stuff

 * color the time differently when there isn't much time left so that 
   people know they're running out of time

 * make the gui experience of clicking edit on a submission and then
   deciding not to better.

 * mute button on player
 * chat: handle join/part messages by removing them or adding them from
   the onliners list
 * settings page

   period of time. or just allow their accounts to be overwritten if they
   are old.

   honor line breaks. maximum: a bb-like system or markdown.
 * compo owner gets skip song controls
