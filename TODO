= arena =
 == to get a prototype working ==
 * competition page
   - chat box
     > chat: show timestamps for messages
     > creating a competition needs to create the room and add it to the compo
   - pre-competition starting behavior
   - in progress competition behavior
   - listening party behavior
   - voting behavior
   - voting closed behavior
   - replay listening party feature
     > put an indicator on the page so you know whether it's live or replay
 * register
 * user profile page
 * settings page
 * make the gui pretty
   - date/time widgets for competition form
 * edit competition
 * protect against bad data with javascript
   - make Jst support auto escaping. can have special function for not escaping.
 * re-implement safe_model_to_dict to make it safer. should probably have
   explicit safe fields in models.
 * put whitelist/blacklist/open in the create competition page. default open.

 == improvements ==
 * pressing enter in the password field should submit the form
 * editing a field when it refreshes
 * the ui glitch when it refreshes
 * protect against h4xz0rz by adding a @method to views which do things like
   login, logout, etc. The method would make sure the referrer was us and not
   some other website.
 * listening party date must be after submission deadline date - put that in
   form validation check
 * implement template caching in Jst parser
 * paging on competitions. right now it sends them all.
 * moderation tools for competitions
 * obfuscate media URLs to protect people's stuff
 * provide some way to format themes, rules, comments, etc
 * chat colors
 * display error when chat message doesn't go through
