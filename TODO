   and the entries re-order, it will show you as listening to the wrong entry.
 * show competition length as metadata
 * auto theme generator
 * beginning of song gets cut off during listening party. set it up
   so that it sets up a setTimeout() to play it right on time instead
   of cutting into the time.
