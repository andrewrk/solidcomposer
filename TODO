Release "Boten Anna"
= sitewide
 * pricing & signup page
 * code to bill customers monthly
   > set it up so that it sends me an email of what it's about to do, then
     I manually approve it and bill everybody.
 * home page
   > if not logged in, it's an attractive pricing & signup page
   > if logged in, it's a dashboard with good stuff on it
 * javascript tests
 * terms of service
 * gotta follow copyright on the icons from icon finder. have a database of icons used
   with authors and a link so that I can have an attribution page at the bottom.
 * tip framework. tips should explain everything complicated and be a little (tip) link 
   next to the item. mousing over should bring up the tip and moving away from the link
   should hide the tip. you should be able to turn off tips in account settings. there
   should be an X next to each tip link, and clicking it will hide that particular tip
   permanently.
 * have a backup plan for the database
 * make sure the tempfile cron job is working
 * user voice
 * blog post announcing release
 * password recovery
 * editor controls on fields that will be parsed by showdown.
   > http://wmd-editor.com/
 * design iteration
 * migration to create projects and versions for everything on the site.

= chat
 * don't render ALL the chat messages every time.
 * download mp3: box instead of link
 * hyperlinks
 * sometimes the design gets put into multiple lines (caused by long unwrapped messages)
   > urls and things that don't wrap screw up chat
 * tab completion for names
 * page up / down to scroll up and down
 * /me action

= arena
 * longer entry names look bad in the entry list
 * tests need to use storage instead of file system
 * do we cap file size on source file? count it against their quota?
 * it's possible to double-vote for someone
 * the listening party starts over after it ends. whoops.
 * entry list: "so far" is misleading. use a better word.
 * send emails when voting results are in
 * there's a security hole - javascript knows where the song mp3s are way
   before it should.
 * make sure Player works seamlessly
 * new competition form: if you uncheck "have listening party," it should hide
   "listening party date"
 * beginning of song gets cut off during listening party. set it up
   so that it sets up a setTimeout() to play it right on time instead
   of cutting into the time.
 * listening party - make song comments during chat during listening party
 * user profile page
   - show their competition entries
 * show and allow posting comments on songs on user pages
 * arena home GUI Redesign

= song player
 * dependencies dialog: have a Samples heading.
   - if any missing samples: in red say e.g. "17 Missing Samples"
     > there should be a tip next to this explaining how it works.
   - if any downloadable samples: have a samples link which closes the dialog and opens the samples dialog.
 * upload a song with a lot of missing samples. upload the samples.
 * don't cover up the waveform with the comment box
 * make sure it behaves properly during listening party

= workbench
 * project page
   > upload samples as new version
     - small player to preview
       # create a low quality mp3 preview of every sample uploaded so that we are able to play all sample types
   > poke
     - can poke max. once every day
   > test checking in a new version from a different window and make sure it works well
   > paging on versions
   > make #anchor names work for versions. currently they don't work automatically because the <a name="aoeu"> is
     created after the page loads.
 * project manager (band page)
   > make filters work
     - use an ordered dictionary for the filters.
     - learn the initial filter from the anchor name
   > quick ui for actions
   > vote to scrap
   > vote to promote
   > show widget indicating how much space is used / left and how to upgrade
 * create band page
   > Choose a name and then proceed directly to band settings page
 * band settings page
 * workbench page
   > ability to create band invitations
     - creating a link to hand out
     - direct invitation on the person's user page
     - a box with auto-complete to direct invite people

     - crtitiques on songs
     - songs checked in
     - songs checked out
     - pokes
   > show widget indicating how much space is used / left and how to upgrade
 * make it so that a user's plan gives him a certain amount of 
   credits, which can be spent on any band.

   > log in - everything should appear
   > should never have to leave the page
 * tests
 

= sitewide =
 * refactor: django already has a storage engine type thing. use it instead
   of my own hacked class
 * stats
   # on songs
     > how many plays
       - partial
       - complete
     > how many downloads
   # band page views
   # fans
 * when you click something to load the next page, replace the contents with
   the loading thing
 * ability to change password
 * make the login ALWAYS ajax. the consistency will help user confidence.
 * IE8 support
 * refactor
   > change competitions to arena
   > change workshop to workbench
 * user settings:
   > connect a user's account with last.fm to scrobble tracks that they listen to
   > ability to check/uncheck plugins that a user owns
   > whether to bleepy boop when people chat
 * serializablemodel: should only follow chains if the names match
 * refactor: add the <pre></pre> stripping to AIM instead of doing it every time.

= chat =
 * clicking onliners should open a new window
 * increase onliners timeout
 * make the chat more friendly to use for people who are used to IRC
   > make the page flash (or change the title text to indicate) when 
     someone's name is mentioned in IRC
   > ability to private message?
   > display error when chat message doesn't go through
 * display how many invisible observers there are
   - by IP address?

= arena =
 * user-highlighted song text is mis-aligned
 * userpage open in a new window
 * show listening party buffer time
 * ability to just set a delay for a listening party as opposed to a date
 * if you're listening to an entry during voting, and then voting ends
   and the entries re-order, it will show you as listening to the wrong entry.
 * show competition length as metadata
 * auto theme generator
 * arena - the competitions aren't updating on a second based timer
   > make it a second-based timer but not suck to click the link
 * if creating a competition fails, have a message at the top saying
   "please correct these errors."
 * show upcoming/new competitions before old ones in bookmarked
   competitions. there should be a clear divide.
   > better competition ordering in arena
 * edit competition
 * better moderator features
   > ability to pause, skip, previous in listening party
   > ability to open submission up even during listening party
   > ability to kick people out (blacklist) if they're misbehaving

 * when they click resubmit, scroll down the page to see the form.
 * put whitelist/blacklist/open in the create competition page. default open.
   - invitation system based on passwords
   - ability to have private compo by invitation
 * ability to replay the listening party
   - put an indicator on the page so you know whether it's live or replay
 * protect against h4xz0rz by adding a @method to views which do things like
   login, logout, etc. The method would make sure the referrer was us and not
   some other website.

   people know they're running out of time
 * play a noise that indicates listening party is starting

 * allow uploading ogg
 * Integrate chat from an IRC channel.
 * google calendar integration
 * rss feed for competitions
 * ability to customize the design

= song player
 * comments
   - handle the case when they're not logged in. it should guide them through the process smoothly
   - glitchy behavior when trying to click the x on a comment box during song playback
     > if they click the x during playback, take it as clicking the hide comments button.
   - if deleting a comment ends up meaning that you can delete a tree, do it. maybe do this on a cron job.
   click the download samples button. they're missing from the box.

= workbench =

     - download count in the past 24 hours
     - play count in the past 24 hours
     - new fan count in the past 24 hours

   > add a description and photo field for plugins
   > come up with a plan for how they get updated. (possibly a simple link to
     notify that information is outdated?)
 * refactor: PluginDepenency mispelled
 * warning when you upload a song to a band, if any of the band members are
   missing dependencies
 * it's misleading to have the song rename field and not support renames without a project.

 * handle ambiguous samples with a choice when the song is uploaded.
   > one of the choices should be: use sample X, and delete the other one
 * allow clearing samples or deleting individual ones

 * ability to create albums and organize like that
