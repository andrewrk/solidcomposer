            The result that came back from Amazon doesn't look like it's really from Amazon.
            Either you're being very naughty, or something is broken.

        <p>
            Either way, we've kept you up with the {{ plan.title }} plan for now. If this is a legitimate 
            error, please <a href="{% url contact %}">contact support</a>.
