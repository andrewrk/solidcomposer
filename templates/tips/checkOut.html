    <p>
        Check out a project just before you begin working on it. This ensures that 
        nobody else can check it out while you are working on it. This way, you
        can't clobber each other's work.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are done working, check the project back in. SolidComposer will
        keep track of every version so you can always go back to a previous version
        if you liked it better.
