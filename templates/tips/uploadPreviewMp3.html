        Use your studio to render a preview of the project in MP3 format and upload it here.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may skip this step if you are lazy, but keep in mind you and particularly your
        band members will have a better experience if you can listen to the songs on
        SolidComposer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nobody but you and your band members have access to your rendered preview songs.
