We will also use that PII to establish and maintain your account (e.g. to send you important information about Service updates or customer surveys) and provide you with the features we provide for Registered Users, e.g. for the purpose of sending you our monthly newsletter as provided in Section 2(e) below.</p>
        <p><strong>(b)  Public Page.</strong>
        Registered Users on the Website are automatically provided with a public page where you may post PII for public viewing. You are not required to post PII or any other information or content on this page, but may post it in your own sole discretion (although any information posted remains subject to SOLIDCOMPOSER’s Terms of Use). Please note that the information you publish on your public page, including your PII but not your email address, becomes public information that can be viewed by others and that the data shown on the Website including PII you provide in your public profile can be accessed through the Internet (directly on our Website or through SOLIDCOMPOSER’s Application Programming Interface) and thus worldwide.</p>

        You may share the information from your public page on SOLIDCOMPOSER with other websites through “Connect with SolidComposer” upon your explicit prior consent and may revoke access of such other websites to your public profile on SOLIDCOMPOSER at any time.

SOLIDCOMPOSER does not sell or otherwise distribute your payment information.</p>

        We use the PII you provide to us when you send us emails to respond to your request, for example to reply to your email.
